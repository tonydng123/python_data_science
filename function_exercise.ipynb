    "These are passed in to your function as ints. \n",
    "In python you can accept an uncertain number of arguments in functions like this using \n",
    "the *args parameter in the function. The function treats these parameter objects as a \n",
    "tuple. So if you passed in 4,5,6,7 as arguments when calling your function, the function\n",
    "would receive a tuple (4,5,6,7) as its parameter. You are required to write a function\n",
    "which takes the value of these integers as *args and works according to the following \n",

    "a) If the sum of all the integers are less than or equal to 21, return their sum in the \n",

    "more 11's and if so, reduce the sum by 10 again. \n",

    "already), return 'Busted!'.\n",
